# HollowSilk

This project uses local npm scripts for development and testing. Before running
any commands like `npm test` or `npm run dev`, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

The scripts rely on tools such as `concurrently` from `node_modules`, so running
`npm install` ensures they are available.


On Replit, be sure to run `npm install` first so TypeScript can find all modules.
